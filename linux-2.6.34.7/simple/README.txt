Here are the results of our First Fit Algorithm:

     Claimed Memory: 119291904	 = ~119MB
     Free Memory:    219434	 = ~219KB

Here are the results of our Best Fit Algorithm:

     Claimed Memory: 119316480	 = ~119MB
     Free Memory:    55884	 = ~55KB

As seen above, the best fit algorith greatly reduced fragmentaion at the expense of speed.
